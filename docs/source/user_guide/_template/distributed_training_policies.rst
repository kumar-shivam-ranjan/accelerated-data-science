.. admonition:: Distributed Training with OCI Data Science
  :class: note

  You need to configure your `networking <https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/overview.htm>`_
  and `IAM <https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm>`_ policies.
  We recommend running the training on a private subnet.
  In this example, internet access is needed to download the source code and the pre-trained model.
